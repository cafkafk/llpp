Prerequisites for building from sources:
    bash          [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash_(Unix_shell)]
    mupdf         [https://mupdf.com]
    opengl        [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenGL]
    git           [https://git-scm.com]
    ocaml 4.12.0  [https://ocaml.org]
        If not present will be downloaded from the network and
        built/used locally without system-wide installation.
        This requires either:
            wget    [https://www.gnu.org/software/wget]
            or curl [https://curl.haxx.se]

    asciidoc      [https://asciidoc.org/]
                  Is needed if one wants to build man pages

To download mupdf+prerequisites that llpp is known to work with:
   - mkdir build && sh misc/getmupdf.sh build/mupdf

To build llpp (binary will be in build/llpp):
   - bash build.bash build

To build man pages (will be in build/doc/[name].1)
   - bash build.bash build doc

There is an issue (investigatin ongoing)

CAML_CC='ccache gcc' or CAML_CC=clang "fixes" it
